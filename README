As one might think, this is a Chess Clock; a simple program to keep track of the time each player in a game of chess has taken.

"src" is from the project's main folder in NetBeans ("NetBeansProjects/chessClock") and includes the .form file NetBeans's GUI editor uses. If one is not using NetBeans, the .form file is useless.

Compile from src:

//

Abandoned NetBeans and it's GUI builder. Compile chessClockGUI.java from above it's directory, which must be "chessclock".




Pending - 

Fix the GUI:
  Align the elements properly
  Make the system for hiding the first elements shown better?
Add a pause button
Cause the whole screen to change colour, instead of just the box?


switchUI() does not work. It must be made to work with CardLayout's functionality.
Components must be added to panel2 and panel3 (the 2nd and 3rd cards).
All cards need a layout manager themselves (GroupLayout, the same as NetBeans uses. Hopefully I will have better luck using it manually.)
