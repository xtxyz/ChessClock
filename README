As one might think, this is a Chess Clock; a simple program to keep track of the time each player in a game of chess has taken.

Fix the GUI:
  Align the elements properly
  Make the system for hiding the first elements shown better?
Add a pause button
Cause the whole screen to change colour, instead of just the box?
