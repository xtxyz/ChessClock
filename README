As one might think, this is a Chess Clock; a simple program to keep track of the time each player in a game of chess has taken.

"src" is from the project's main folder in NetBeans ("NetBeansProjects/chessClock") and includes the .form file NetBeans's GUI editor uses. If one is not using NetBeans, the .form file is useless.
